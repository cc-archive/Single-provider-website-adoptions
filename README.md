# Single-provider-website-adoptions
Separate from platform initiative, this project deals with CC license adoptions for single provider websites and projects, aka those that host materials owned by one entity and are usually governed by one blanket CC license. Contributors add issues regarding adoption of CC licenses by these entities, including improvements to current implementations. Examples of single provider websites are Saylor.org and MIT OpenCourseWare. Platforms with a community of contributors such as Flickr and Vimeo are covered by CC's [platform initiative](https://github.com/creativecommons/platform-initiative).
